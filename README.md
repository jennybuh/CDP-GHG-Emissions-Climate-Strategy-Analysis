# CDP-GHG-Emissions-Climate-Strategy-Analysis

This data analysis project is a passion project, and of a topic that is very close to my heart.
The project is primarily a descriptive analysis that examines historical data to identify linear trends.

I conducted an analysis to identify trend of GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions for U.S. cities/organizations reporting to the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) between 2017 and 2022, 
and specifically how the trends measured against their respective climate strategy targets.

I worked independently for 5 weeks to outline the project, extract, clean, and visualize GHG emission data.

The datasets for city/organization emission, climate strategy plans, and emission reduction targets were obtained from the CDPâ€™s public database.

Excel, SQL, and Tableau were used in combination to complete this projejct.

The results from the analysis show that from their most recently reported emission year, 76% of the cities/organizations had a decrease in 
total annual emission amounts relative to their designated baseline year for emissions. The other 24% of showed an increase.
